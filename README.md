# Data-Science-Pandas-Analysis
Analysing many files using Pandas.


In this project I have analysed many files containing numerous informations about sales, dates, time, location, products and so on.

Some question was created to analyse the data and interprete it.

<strong>These are the following questions:</strong>

Question 1: What was the best month for sales ? How much was earned that month ?

Question 2: What city had the highest number of sales ?

Question 3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of custumer's buying product ?

Question 4: What products are most often sold together ?

Question 5: What product sold the most ? Why do you think it sold the most ?
